Hello people looking at the stuff for our code review.

We are sending our whole solutions. Will probly not compile because of the librarys we are using that you probably dont have!

Just some fyi's:

- We don't have our database hooked up yet. The only thing it is used for it to create a robot, using hardcoded data that pretends to be our database.

- We are using dijks as our pathing algorithm. If you want to look at it go ahead. We are sure it could be improved but that is not the focus of our system.

- Timer is not used. This is because how we currently have it set up threading seems to be impossible. We will need to do some refactoring of our system to get it set up. If you want more information ask during the presentation.

That is really all. Have fun, and sorry for some missed commenting.
